                Data breaches are common events in the current digital world. How the companies deal with it, also play an equally important role. Uber was subjected to a data breach in late 2016. The company was not much criticized as its take on this attack was.
                <br>
                The breach resulted in compromising names, mobile phone numbers and email addresses of 57 million Uber users and 600,000 Uber driverâ€™s driver license numbers.
                <br>
                The company discovered of the breach in late 2016 but made it public almost after a year. Not only that the company offered the hackers an amount of massive $100,000 to destroy the data without verifying they actually did.
                <br>
                The breach had resulted in the loss of both the reputation and finances of the company. The company was in negotiation to sell its stakes to Softbank, at the time the breach was announced. The breach lowered the value of the deal from $68 billion to $48 billion.
